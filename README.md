# Diamond Price Prediction Model

## Overview
This project builds a **diamond price prediction model** using machine learning techniques. The dataset consists of 54,000 diamond records, including attributes like carat, cut, color, clarity, and dimensions. The goal is to predict the price of a diamond based on these attributes.

## Dataset
The dataset contains the following features:
- **price**: Diamond price in US dollars ($326 - $18,823)
- **carat**: Weight of the diamond (0.2 - 5.01)
- **cut**: Quality of the cut (Fair, Good, Very Good, Premium, Ideal)
- **color**: Diamond color, from J (worst) to D (best)
- **clarity**: Measurement of how clear the diamond is (I1 (worst) to IF (best))
- **x, y, z**: Dimensions of the diamond in mm
- **depth**: Total depth percentage = z / mean(x, y)
- **table**: Width of the top of the diamond relative to the widest point
